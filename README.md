- 👋 Hi, I’m Eva (Wenyu) Liu
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gen AI, especially building Gen AI based AI Agents.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating AI Agents based on different real-life use cases.
- ✨ Fun fact about stars: Constellations are patterns of stars in the sky. They are often named after mythological figures or animals. The stars in a constellation are not necessarily close to each other in space. They just happen to line up in a way that forms a pattern from our viewpoint on Earth.
